# TensorFlow #

This folder contains a few tutorials for beginners of TensorFlow. The goal of this series of tutorial is to introduce the reader to the basic concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and, more specifically, to the Deep Learning (DL) algorithm using engaging examples and posing challenging questions. The final idea is to make a series of youtube videos. The main source for this tutorial is "Zero to Hero" from TensorFlow.  

## First Tutorial: Computer_Vision.ipynb ## 

In this first tutorial, we move to the first steps with TensorFlow. The goal is not to explain exactly all the algorithms behind the Neural Network (NN) optimization but rather give a first feeling on the concepts behind ML. We create a simple, single-layer NN to recognize different objects from a set of images extracted from the omnipresent MNIST library. 

# Machine Learning and Quantum Computing # 

This is a collection of a few examples which incorporate ML methods for clustering and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and quantum computer alghoritms. The main focus of this examples is related to chemistry and molecular dynamics. Even tough it is not complete yet, I aim to produce a comprehsive set of eamples usable by computational chemistry and AI engeeneers. The examples aim to make clear the key concepts behind ML and Quantum Computing (QC) alghorithms that can be applied to chemistry and molecular dynamics.
